### 1. **OpenSSL CVE-2022-3602**
**Project Type**: High Vulnerability Discovery
**Description**: I identified a **buffer overrun vulnerability** in the X.509 certificate verification process, specifically during name constraint checking. This issue could allow an attacker to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack by crafting a malicious email address. The buffer overflow might lead to a crash (denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. However, many platforms implement stack overflow protections that mitigate the risk of remote code execution, and further mitigations depend on platform/compiler-specific stack layout.

I collaborated with relevant teams to ensure this vulnerability was addressed in OpenSSL 3.0.7, which resolved the issue. Users are strongly advised to update their software to this version, as the vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6. This issue, initially rated as CRITICAL, was downgraded to HIGH due to mitigating factors.
- **[View CVE Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3602)**

### 1. **OpenSSL CVE-2022-3786**
**Project Type**: High Vulnerability Discovery
**Description**: I identified a **buffer overrun vulnerability** in the X.509 certificate verification process, specifically in the name constraint checking phase. This issue can be exploited when an attacker crafts a malicious email address within a certificate, causing an arbitrary number of bytes containing the . character (decimal 46) to overflow on the stack. The resulting buffer overflow could lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.

In a TLS client, this vulnerability can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, it can be exploited if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.
